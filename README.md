# Piper-Color-Characterization

To color-characterize different species of the Piper pepper plant, we used the "recolorize" package in R. First, all the pictures of the Piper plant samples were color-corrected and cropped with a transparent background in GIMP. The recolorize2 function was used for color clustering and the prcomp function in R was used to conduct principal component analysis.

The code file is "piper_color_characterization.R".
